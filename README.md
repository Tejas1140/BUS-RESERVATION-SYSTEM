# BUS-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
A travel agency wants to build a specialized site where multiple customers can check the availability of seats and book bus tickets. The system manages information about employees, buses, users, passengers, queries, and tickets. Throughout the project, we see that a user (passenger or admin) is asked to the first login and is then redirected to the dashboard. The user will then input the source and destination cities with the preferred date of travel, available buses will then be shown to the user and he/she can check for available seats. After selecting the seats, the user can book the seats and proceed towards payment. After booking, if the user wants to cancel their booking, they can do that easily. The users have the ability to view their booked tickets as well as their traveling history. The user can contact the concerned employee/authority if he/she has any queries regarding payment or booking in the contact us section.

Objectives:
1. Providing a web-based bus ticket reservation function where a customer can buy bus tickets through the online system.
2. Enabling customers to check the availability and types of buses online.
3. Customers can check the departure time for every bus through the system.
4. Ability of customers to cancel their reservations.
5. Admin user privileges in updating and canceling payment, route, and vehicle records.
